============

FreeSASA is intended do one thing and do it well. No major new features are anticipated.
Bugs and inconsistencies in the API or CLI will however be fixed, please report these as GitHub issues.

I only work on FreeSASA in my spare time, so any help with resolving open issues is appreciated.
Pull requests are welcome, especially for open issues. 
Before submitting a PR, make sure your changes do not break any tests.
If they do, due to modifications to core functionality,
make sure the changes are properly documented and the tests are modified accordingly.
Before any new features will be accepted into the master branch they must have unit tests with full coverage,
but feel free to submit a PR without tests and I will try to help out.

Issues with the Python module should preferrably be posted in that
[repository](https://github.com/freesasa/freesasa-python).
